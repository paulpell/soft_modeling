\section{Introduction}
In modern computer science the field of computer graphics has gained much impulse due to faster performing devices, better and quicker memory access times and of course more efficient methods of algorithmic computation. Thus more and more realistic and complex scenes can be rendered by computational means and finally displayed on digital devices. This project will give a small overview over the technique of "soft modeling".

\section{Modeling Soft Objects}
When modeling the world solid objects such as e.g. a cube have clearly defined static shapes and appearance in the three-dimensional space. So called "soft objects" on the other hand are more flexible and can take various shapes and forms. Storing softer objects and their interaction with their surroundings needs therefore more thought as the solids.\\[1em]
%
There have been several models developed for modeling soft objects. The following paper will focus on the spring model approach described by \cite{LSCS} and \cite{hair}\cite{gama}.\\[1em]

\subsection{Spring}
A spring is a mechanical devices, that is able to store and release kinetical energy. With given material properties a spring can be bent and twisted and be keept in this state until the bending force is released and the spring will return to its orignial state. As a mathematical approximation of the real world spring there is the very simple rule called \textit{Hooke's law}:
$$F=-kx$$
Where the force $F$ existing between the two ends of the spring is equal to the difference of displacement $x$ from its original state into a material or force constant $k$. If a spring is changed in its length, then at the both ends a mass $m$ will be moved with the acceleration $a$:
$$-kx = ma$$

\subsection{Spring Model}
In the so called spring model objects are modeled in such a way, that the respective masspoints of the object are connected by springs.

\subsection{Wireframe}
In the wireframe representation of an object we can see where appropiate masspoints are. Edges between these points can be drawn and considered either as a plain edge (e.g. for visial effects) or as a spring as above. Depending on how many springs we use in an object different forces will be present and convey different stability and behavior to the object if forces are applied.

\section{Results}
The main objectives of the project are solved:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Useage of wireframe to model objects}
\item{then use of spring model to provide softness}
\item{then rendering using OpenGL}
\item{Effects of stress shown by physical forces such as gravity}
\end{itemize}

\textit{Outlook for the project:}\\
With advanced time measuring methods the physical frame rate should be adapted to the graphical frame rate. Since our computations on the objects are functions of time $\Delta t$ the painting with is done by the OpenGL framework is a function of the speed of the graphics processor and displaying device (measured in $frames-per-second=fps$). Due to different $fps$ on different devices the physical framerate has to be adjusted to fit what the eye is seeing to improve the smoothness of the animation.\\[1em]

\section{Conclusion}
With a very simple physical equation the Spring Mass Model achieves a very realistic behavior of objects. If we work with more advanced models, with denser wireframes or within-springs with different hardness, even more advanced objects can be modelled. Since the Wireframe approach to model objects in computer graphics is very wastly present the Spring Mass Model is quite handy, since it can be easily put onto an existing wireframe, additional springs maybe added though to keep the object solid, otherwise it would simply collapse into itself.
